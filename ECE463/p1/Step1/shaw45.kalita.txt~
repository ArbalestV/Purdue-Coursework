Everything seems to be working. We checked with different filenames, existing/non-existing files, and with readable and non-readable permissions. We also checked for filenames that began with '/'. We ran the concurrent server with our own client at one side and with the sample client on the other, and it was servicing both clients. The PING ACK return sequence numbers were correct.
