My partner for this lab was Everett Berry, with who I had collaborated on the RTL timer homework, lab 4 and who will be one of my team members for the semester project.

2. Everett and I started work on this lab on Sunday, and we came up with our own designs and talked about the various states. We wanted to make sure we did our states right because we knew coding would be extremely easy if the diagrams (especially FSM diagrams) were made right. After that we proceeded to code our own blocks, and communicated about the various errors we were getting and how we could get rid of them. 

3. Everett and I met everyday from Monday to Tuesday to work on the design. Also, when we would work from our homes, we would stay in constant touch just to confirm any doubts we might have.

4. Personally, I contributed just as much to the team effort as Everett like mentioned in response #2. We didn't have any clear division in the sense that he was responsible for one part of the design, me the other and so on. We agreed on the design first, then went on to code it individually. Obviously, during the code, we would help each other to fix any bugs and so forth. 

5. One thing that I have learned from Everett over the various collaborations so far is the amount of confidence one ought to have in themselves. He doesn't second guess himself, he has that basic condfidence in himself. He is not afraid to go out there, write the code and then deal with the errors. Whereas I have always thought of the consequences before coding.
