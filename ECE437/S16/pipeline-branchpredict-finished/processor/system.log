Note: For more information on problematic transfers, consider running the Fitter again with the Optimize hold timing option (Settings Menu) turned off.
This will disable optimization of problematic paths and expose them for further analysis using either the TimeQuest Timing Analyzer or the Classic Timing Analyzer.

; Fitter Messages ;
+-----------------+
Info (20032): Parallel compilation is enabled and will use up to 4 processors
Info (119006): Selected device EP4CE115F29C8 for design "system"
Info (21076): High junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '85'.
Info (21076): Low junction temperature operating condition is not set. Assuming a default value of '0'.
Info (171003): Fitter is performing an Auto Fit compilation, which may decrease Fitter effort to reduce compilation time
Info (176444): Device migration not selected. If you intend to use device migration later, you may need to change the pin assignments as they may be incompatible with other devices

This panel reports FMAX for every clock in the design, regardless of the user-specified clock periods.  FMAX is only computed for paths where the source and destination registers or ports are driven by the same clock.  Paths of different clocks, including generated clocks, are ignored.  For paths between a clock and its inversion, FMAX is computed as if the rising and falling edges are scaled along with FMAX, such that the duty cycle (in terms of a percentage) is maintained. Altera recommends that you always use clock constraints and other slack reports for sign-off analysis.

This panel reports FMAX for every clock in the design, regardless of the user-specified clock periods.  FMAX is only computed for paths where the source and destination registers or ports are driven by the same clock.  Paths of different clocks, including generated clocks, are ignored.  For paths between a clock and its inversion, FMAX is computed as if the rising and falling edges are scaled along with FMAX, such that the duty cycle (in terms of a percentage) is maintained. Altera recommends that you always use clock constraints and other slack reports for sign-off analysis.
