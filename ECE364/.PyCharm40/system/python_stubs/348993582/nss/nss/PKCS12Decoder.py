        :Parameters:
            level : integer

                to this starting level.
        
        Formats the object into a sequence of lines with indent level
        information.  The return value is a list where each list item is a
        tuple.  The first item in the tuple is an integer
        representing the indentation level for that line. Any remaining items
        in the tuple are strings to be output on that line.
        
        The output of this function can be formatted into a single string by
        calling `indented_format()`, e.g.:
        
            print indented_format(obj.format_lines())
        
        The reason this function returns a tuple as opposed to an single
        indented string is to support other text formatting systems such as
        GUI's with indentation controls.  See `indented_format()` for a
        complete explanation.
